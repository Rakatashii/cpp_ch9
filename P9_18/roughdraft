Dear Mrs. Schwimmer, I hope you hare having a great zummer. I am contacting you to let u know that fiwe of the seven dishes have grown according to our hypotheses. I suspect that the two that did not grow according to our expectatons were not synthesized correctly in the first place due to the exces exposure theyv had to sunlight during that phase. Please let me kno if ud like me to repeat the growth cycles under these conditons. Best, Christa.
